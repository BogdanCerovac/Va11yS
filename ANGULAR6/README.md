# Angular 6 Examples
These Angular 6 examples are a single page Angular application deployed on GitHub. 
It was created using the [Angular CLI](https://cli.angular.io/) and the [Angular Tour of Heroes tutorial](https://angular.io/tutorial). Accessibility test results are included at the bottom of the page.

To see the working demo, go to [Angular 6 Example](https://snidersd.github.io/).

The source code is in the [Accessible Angular](https://github.com/snidersd/accessible-angular) GitHub repository.

To improve accessibility, the following packages have been added to the application:
- [W3C WAI ARIA Landmarks](https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/wiki/Using_ARIA_landmarks_to_identify_regions_of_a_page) to identify regions to a page.
- Styles to improve color contrast.
